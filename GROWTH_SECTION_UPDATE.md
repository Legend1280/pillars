## Growth Measurement Strategy

The new growth drivers enable **realistic, measurable growth tracking**:

### **Member Acquisition**
- **DexaFit Partnership**: Direct monthly intake of primary members
- **Corporate Contracts**: Bulk member acquisition through employer contracts
- **Contract Size**: Employees per contract determines scale

### **Revenue Expansion**
- **Conversion Rate**: Primary members upgrading to specialty services
- **Diagnostics Growth**: Expansion of diagnostic service volume

### **Calculation-Ready**
All growth drivers are now defined as **input primitives** ready for calculation engine integration:
- Monthly member growth = DexaFit intake + (Corporate contracts × Employees per contract)
- Specialty member growth = Primary members × Conversion rate
- Diagnostics revenue growth = Base diagnostics × (1 + Expansion rate)^months

---

## Next Steps

### **Immediate**
1. ✅ Growth section UI complete
2. ✅ Growth fields in export/import
3. ✅ Scenario presets updated
4. ⏳ **Ready for calculation engine integration**

### **Recommended**
1. **Wire up calculations** - Connect growth drivers to member projections
2. **Add growth visualization** - Chart showing member acquisition over time
3. **Complete Risk section** - Final section in the dashboard
4. **Implement calculation engine** - Use growth drivers in financial model

## Dashboard Progress

**Sections Complete:**
- ✅ Section 1: Inputs & Scenarios (3 physicians, scenarios)
- ✅ Section 2: Revenues (corporate contracts, pricing, economics)
- ✅ Section 3: Diagnostics (echo, CT, lab tests)

## ✅ What We Built

### 1. Complete Ontology Mapping (128 Nodes)

**File**: `client/src/lib/calculationGraphEnhanced.ts`

- **128 total nodes** mapped with rich metadata
- **96 dependency edges** with impact weights (1-10)
- **4 node types**: input (86), derived (14), calculation (18), output (10)
- **8 sections**: Inputs, Revenues, Costs, Staffing, Ramp, Growth, Risk, Outputs
- **4 layers**: 0-3 (dependency depth)

**Metadata per node**:
- id, label, type, category, description
- formula, codeSnippet
- section (1-8), unit (dollars/percentage/count/months/boolean/ratio/hours)
- expectedRange (min/max for validation)
- defaultValue, businessLogic
- layer (dependency depth)

**Edge metadata**:
- source, target, weight (1-10)
- Critical path tracking (weight >= 9)

### 2. AI Analyzer Integration

**Files**:
- `server/routes/ai-analyzer.ts` - GPT-4 API endpoint with structured outputs
- `client/src/components/AIAnalyzerTab.tsx` - UI for AI analysis

**Features**:
- Dr. Sarah Chen persona (MSO healthcare finance expert)
- OpenAI GPT-4o with structured outputs (guaranteed valid JSON)
- Comprehensive analysis:
  - Health Score (0-100)
  - Critical Issues (with severity: high/medium/low)
  - Missing Connections (from/to/reason)
  - Recommendations (prioritized: critical/high/medium/low)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### OpenAI Structured Outputs

Used proper JSON schema with `response_format: { type: "json_schema" }` to guarantee valid JSON responses:

```typescript
const analysisSchema = {
  type: "json_schema",
  json_schema: {
    name: "OntologyAnalysis",
    schema: {
      type: "object",
      required: ["status"],
      properties: {
        status: { enum: ["ok", "noop"] },
        healthScore: { type: "number", minimum: 0, maximum: 100 },
        // ... full schema
      }
    },
    strict: true
  }
};
```

### API Integration

- Model: `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` (required for structured outputs)
- Max tokens: 4000
- Temperature: 0.7
- Response format: Structured JSON schema

### Helper Functions

```typescript
// Get all downstream nodes (what changes when this node changes)
getDownstreamNodes(nodeId, graph)

// Get all upstream nodes (what this node depends on)
getUpstreamNodes(nodeId, graph)

// Filter nodes by section
getNodesBySection(sectionId, graph)

// Filter nodes by layer
getNodesByLayer(layerId, graph)

// Get critical path (high-impact nodes)
getCriticalPath(graph) // weight >= 9
```

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### API Route Not Working

**Problem**: The `/api/analyze-ontology` endpoint returns HTML instead of JSON when called from the frontend.

**Root Cause**: Express routing issue - the catch-all `app.get("*")` handler is matching API routes before they can be processed.

**Evidence**:
- curl to `http://localhost:3002/api/analyze-ontology` returns HTML
- Server logs don't show "📡 Registering API routes at /api" message
- Debug logging middleware not triggering

**Attempted Fixes**:
1. ✅ Added API routes before static file serving
2. ✅ Added debug logging middleware
3. ✅ Used structured outputs to guarantee valid JSON
4. ❌ Route still not being matched

**Next Steps**:
1. Check if `server/routes/ai-analyzer.ts` is being compiled correctly
2. Verify the import path in `server/index.ts`
3. Test if the route works when accessed directly (not through frontend)
4. Consider using a different route prefix (e.g., `/api/v1/analyze-ontology`)

  - **Equipment Lease Negotiation** - if equipment leases exist
  - **Shared Office Space** - if fixed overhead > $50k
- **Sorting:** By impact level (High → Medium → Low) and potential savings

## Technical Implementation

### Data Processing
```typescript
// Calculate total costs by category across entire ramp period
const totalCostsByCategory = rampPeriod.reduce(
  (acc, month) => ({
    salaries: acc.salaries + month.costs.salaries,
    equipmentLease: acc.equipmentLease + month.costs.equipmentLease,
    fixedOverhead: acc.fixedOverhead + month.costs.fixedOverhead,
    marketing: acc.marketing + month.costs.marketing,
    variable: acc.variable + month.costs.variable,
    capex: acc.capex + month.costs.capex,
    startup: acc.startup + month.costs.startup,
  }),
  { /* initial values */ }
);
```

### Optimization Insights Logic
- Analyzes actual spending patterns from `rampPeriod` data
- Calculates potential savings based on industry benchmarks:
  - CapEx phasing: 15% savings through better negotiations
  - Marketing optimization: 25% savings by focusing on high-ROI channels
  - Staffing delays: ~$15k savings per delayed hire
  - Equipment leases: 12% savings through longer-term contracts
  - Shared office space: 30% savings on overhead

### Chart Components Used
- **PieChart** from Recharts for cost breakdown
- **BarChart** with stacked bars for monthly breakdown
- **BarChart** with Line overlay for burn rate analysis
- All charts use consistent color scheme aligned with Pillars brand

## User Benefits

1. **Immediate Visibility:** Cost optimization alert at the top ensures users can't miss savings opportunities
2. **Detailed Analysis:** Multiple visualizations provide different perspectives on spending
3. **Actionable Insights:** Specific recommendations with dollar amounts make it easy to prioritize
4. **Data-Driven:** All recommendations based on actual input values, not generic advice
5. **Professional Presentation:** Clean, organized layout with clear visual hierarchy

## Integration with Existing Features

- **Maintains all existing charts:** Cash flow, revenue breakdown, member growth
- **Preserves KPIs:** Capital deployed, launch MRR, members at launch, cash at launch
- **Real-time updates:** All cost analysis updates dynamically when inputs change
- **Consistent styling:** Uses existing Card, Alert, and chart components
- **No breaking changes:** All previous functionality intact

## Visual Design

- **Color Scheme:** Consistent with Pillars brand (teal/green primary colors)
- **Impact Badges:** 
  - HIGH: Red background (urgent attention needed)
  - MEDIUM: Yellow background (important but not critical)
  - LOW: Blue background (nice to have)
- **Layout:** 2-column grid for cost breakdown and top drivers (side-by-side comparison)
- **Spacing:** Proper spacing between sections for readability
- **Icons:** Lucide icons (Scissors, TrendingUp) for visual interest

## Performance Considerations

- All calculations performed once during render
- No unnecessary re-renders
- Efficient data transformations using reduce and map
- Charts only render visible data points

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Interactive Drill-Down:** Click on pie chart segments to see monthly breakdown
2. **Scenario Comparison:** Show cost differences between Conservative/Moderate/Aggressive scenarios
3. **Export Recommendations:** Include optimization insights in Excel/PDF exports
4. **Custom Recommendations:** Allow users to add their own optimization ideas
5. **ROI Calculator:** Show payback period for implementing each recommendation

# Calculation Engine Implementation Status

## ✅ COMPLETED

### 1. Calculation Engine (calculations.ts)
- ✅ Ramp period calculations (Months 0-6)
- ✅ Launch state variables (Month 7 snapshot)
- ✅ 12-month projection calculations (Months 7-18)
- ✅ Member growth tracking with churn
- ✅ Revenue streams (Primary, Specialty, Corporate, Diagnostics)
- ✅ Cost tracking (Salaries, Equipment, Overhead, Marketing, Variable, CapEx, Startup)
- ✅ Cash flow and cumulative cash tracking
- ✅ KPI calculations
- ✅ **Number formatting fixed** - All member counts rounded to whole numbers

### 2. Context Integration
- ✅ Calculations integrated into DashboardContext
- ✅ Real-time recalculation on input changes
- ✅ Projections available to all components

### 3. KPI Ribbon
- ✅ Total Revenue (12 mo): $4,848,052
- ✅ MSO Net Profit: $975,696
- ✅ Physician ROI: 229.6%
- ✅ Active Members: 488 (properly formatted)

### 4. Ramp & Launch Tab
- ✅ Total Ramp Burn KPI: $1,002,407
- ✅ Launch MRR KPI: $321,700
- ✅ Members at Launch KPI: 217
- ✅ Cash at Launch KPI: -$1,002,407
- ✅ Ramp Period Cash Flow chart (working)
- ✅ Revenue Build-Up chart (working)
- ✅ Member Growth chart (working)
- ✅ Launch State summary card (working)

## ⚠️ ISSUES TO FIX

### 1. Tab Rendering Problem
- ❌ 12-Month Projection tab: Content not rendering (tab panel has 0 children)
- ❌ P&L Summary tab: Content not rendering (tab panel has 0 children)
- ✅ Ramp & Launch tab: Working perfectly
- ❌ Risk Analysis tab: Placeholder only (expected)

**Symptoms:**
- Tab buttons work (can click and switch)
- Tab panel exists in DOM
- But content components (ProjectionTab, PLSummaryTab) not rendering
- No console errors visible
- No TypeScript errors during build

**Possible Causes:**
1. Component throwing silent errors during render
2. Missing dependencies in components
3. Data structure mismatch
4. Recharts library issue with chart components

### 2. Next Steps
1. Add error boundaries to catch silent component errors
2. Test with simplified versions of ProjectionTab and PLSummaryTab
3. Check if Recharts components are causing issues
4. Verify projection data structure matches component expectations

## 📊 Sample Data

**Ramp Period (Month 6):**
- Primary Members: 120 (from 20/month × 6 months)
- Specialty Members: 96
- Monthly Revenue: ~$100k
- Monthly Costs: ~$300k
- Cumulative Burn: -$1,002,407

**Launch (Month 7):**
- Primary Members: 217 (120 ramp + 97 carry-over)
- Specialty Members: 172 (96 ramp + 76 carry-over)
- Monthly Revenue: $321,700
- Monthly Costs: $298,005
- Equipment Lease: $7,000

**Peak (Month 18):**
- Primary Members: 488
- Total Revenue (12mo): $4,848,052
- Net Profit (12mo): $975,696
- Physician ROI: 229.6%

## 🎯 Calculation Logic Verified

✅ **Ramp Period:**
- Services phase in based on start months
- Staff hired according to schedule
- Equipment lease tied to diagnostic timing
- DexaFit intake: 20/month

✅ **Month 7 Transition:**
- All 4 physicians join
- All carry-over members join (big revenue spike)
- DexaFit intake switches: 20 → 25/month
- All ramp services/staff continue

✅ **Projection Period:**
- Steady-state growth rates apply
- Member churn calculated monthly
- All revenue streams active
- Full team operational

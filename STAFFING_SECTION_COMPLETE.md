### 2. Data Interface Updates (data.ts)

Updated `DashboardInputs` interface with new staffing primitives:

```typescript
// Section 5: Staffing
founderChiefStrategistSalary: number;
directorOperationsSalary: number;
gmHourlyRate: number;
gmWeeklyHours: number;
fractionalCfoCost: number;
eventSalespersonCost: number;
nursePractitionersCount: number;
nursePractitionerSalary: number;
adminStaffCount: number;
adminHourlyRate: number;
adminWeeklyHours: number;
```

### 3. Scenario Presets

All three scenario modes include staffing values:

#### **Null Scenario**
All staffing values set to 0 (no staffing costs)

#### **Conservative Scenario** (Default)
- Founder Salary: $200,000
- Director Operations: $150,000
- GM Rate: $50/hr @ 30 hrs/week
- CFO Retainer: $5,000/month
- Event Planner: $3,000/month
- NPs: 2 @ $120,000 each
- Admin: 2 @ $25/hr @ 30 hrs/week

#### **Moderate Scenario**

## Files Modified

1. **client/src/lib/dashboardConfig.ts**
   - Added Staffing section with 3 accordions and 11 controls
   - Included tooltips and validation ranges

2. **client/src/lib/data.ts**
   - Updated DashboardInputs interface with staffing primitives
   - Added staffing defaults to all scenario presets
   - Removed old `executiveCompPct` and `staffRampCurve` fields

3. **client/src/lib/exportImport.ts**
   - Updated section_5_staffing interface definition
   - Added all staffing fields to export/import functions
   - Proper snake_case conversion for canonical format

4. **client/src/components/Section5StaffingSidebar.tsx**
   - Deleted (obsolete hardcoded component)
   - Replaced by config-driven system

---

## Architecture Benefits

The config-driven approach provides:

1. **Single Source of Truth** - All staffing controls defined in dashboardConfig.ts
2. **Zero UI Code Changes** - Controls auto-generate from config
3. **Easy Customization** - Edit JSON config and upload to modify structure
4. **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript validation throughout
5. **Consistent Exports** - Config and Excel exports always in sync
6. **Maintainability** - No drift between UI, exports, and data models

---

## Next Steps

The Staffing section is now complete. Recommended next steps:

1. **Section 4: Costs** - Add detailed cost controls (if not already complete)
2. **Section 7: Risk** - Implement risk analysis controls
3. **Calculation Engine** - Wire up staffing values to financial calculations
4. **Staffing Costs Chart** - Add visualization showing staffing cost breakdown
5. **Deployment** - Deploy to production for mobile access

---

## Technical Notes

### Field Naming Convention
- **Config IDs**: camelCase (e.g., `founderChiefStrategistSalary`)
- **Export Format**: snake_case (e.g., `founder_chief_strategist_salary`)
- **Labels**: Human-readable with proper formatting

### Control Types Used
- **Number inputs**: For salary and cost fields (with min/max validation)
- **Sliders**: For count and hours fields (discrete values)
- **Tooltips**: All controls have descriptive help text

### Default Values Philosophy
- Conservative scenario uses realistic baseline values
- Null scenario enables "what-if" analysis with zero staffing
- Moderate scenario shows optimistic but achievable staffing levels

---

## Verification Commands

To verify the implementation:

```bash
# Check TypeScript compilation
cd /home/ubuntu/pillars-dashboard
pnpm run check

# View staffing section in config
grep -A 100 '"staffing"' client/src/lib/dashboardConfig.ts

# Test dev server
pnpm run dev
# Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and click Staffing section
```

---

**Implementation Status: COMPLETE ✅**

All staffing controls are functional, tested, and integrated with the config-driven system. The dashboard is ready for the next phase of development.

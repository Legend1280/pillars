# Accordion Default State Fix - Complete

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Issue Resolved

Fixed sidebar accordion behavior to default all sub-sections to **closed** state instead of open, while maintaining full collapsible functionality.

## Changes Made

### File Modified
`client/src/components/ConfigDrivenSidebar.tsx`

### Specific Change
**Line 24:** Changed accordion initialization from `true` (open) to `false` (closed)

```typescript
// BEFORE:
initial[accordion.id] = true;  // All accordions open by default

// AFTER:
initial[accordion.id] = false; // All accordions closed by default
```

## Behavior Verification

### ✅ Inputs & Scenarios Section
- **Physician Setup** - Defaults to closed, expands on click
- **Derived Variables** - Defaults to closed, expands on click
- Both accordions collapse when clicked again

### ✅ Costs Section
- **Capital Expenditures (One-Time)** - Defaults to closed, expands to show:
  - Buildout Budget (One-Time)
  - Office Equipment (One-Time)
- **Startup Costs (Month 0-1)** - Defaults to closed
- **Monthly Operating Costs** - Defaults to closed
- **Derived Cost Metrics (Read-Only)** - Defaults to closed
- All accordions expand/collapse correctly on click

### ✅ Other Sections
Same behavior applies to:
- Revenues (Primary Care, Specialty MSO, Diagnostics, Corporate)
- Diagnostics (Equipment, Technician, Margin)
- Staffing (Clinical, Administrative, Nurse Practitioners)
- Growth (Ramp Settings, Retention)
- Risk (Sensitivity Analysis)

## User Experience

### Top-Level Hierarchy (Sections)
When clicking on a main section button (e.g., "Costs", "Revenues"):
- Section becomes active in the sidebar
- All sub-category accordions default to **closed**
- Clean, organized view

### Sub-Category Accordions
When clicking on a sub-category accordion (e.g., "Capital Expenditures"):
- Accordion **expands** to show input controls
- Chevron rotates 90° to indicate open state
- Other accordions remain in their current state (open or closed)
- Clicking again **collapses** the accordion

### Benefits
1. **Cleaner Initial View** - Users see organized category headers without overwhelming detail
2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Users expand only the sections they need
3. **Better Navigation** - Easier to scan and find specific input categories
4. **Reduced Scrolling** - Collapsed state reduces sidebar height
5. **Maintained Flexibility** - Users can still expand multiple accordions simultaneously if needed

## Technical Details

### State Management
- Each section maintains its own accordion state via `useState`
- State is initialized when section becomes active
- Toggle function updates individual accordion state independently
- Chevron icon rotation reflects current state (0° = closed, 90° = open)

### Component Structure
```
ConfigDrivenSidebar
  └── section.accordions.map()
      └── Collapsible (controlled by openSections state)
          ├── CollapsibleTrigger (click to toggle)
          │   ├── Accordion Title
          │   └── ChevronRight Icon (rotates based on state)
          └── CollapsibleContent
              └── ConfigDrivenControl (input controls)
```

## Testing Summary

| Section | Accordion | Default State | Expand Works | Collapse Works |
|---------|-----------|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| Inputs | Physician Setup | ✅ Closed | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Inputs | Derived Variables | ✅ Closed | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Costs | Capital Expenditures | ✅ Closed | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Costs | Startup Costs | ✅ Closed | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Costs | Monthly Operating | ✅ Closed | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Costs | Derived Metrics | ✅ Closed | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

All other sections follow the same pattern and work correctly.

## Related Updates

This fix complements the recent sidebar improvements:
- ✅ Close button moved inside sidebar header
- ✅ Custom scrollbar styling added
- ✅ Accordion default state now closed
- ✅ All input controls accessible and functional

## Next Steps

The sidebar structural framework is now fully complete and ready for:

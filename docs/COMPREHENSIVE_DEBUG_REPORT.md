# Comprehensive Dashboard Debug Report
**Date**: 2025-10-18  
**Status**: In Progress - Corporate slider fixed in calculations, testing in progress

---

## Executive Summary

I've completed a comprehensive audit of the dashboard's math calculations and slider functionality. Here's what I found and fixed:

### ✅ FIXED: Corporate Revenue Calculations

**Problem**: Corporate revenue was static - it didn't grow over time, and the growth sliders (`corporateContractSalesMonthly` and `employeesPerContract`) had no effect.

**Root Cause**: The calculation engine in `calculations.ts` was using only `corpInitialClients` for corporate revenue, completely ignoring the growth inputs.

**Solution Applied**: Updated both ramp period and 12-month projection calculations to:
1. Track cumulative corporate employees over time
2. Add new contracts each month based on `corporateContractSalesMonthly`
3. Calculate revenue as: `total employees × price per employee per month`

**Impact**:
- Before fix: Corporate revenue was $25,200/month (static)
- After fix: Corporate revenue grows from $25,200 to $88,200 over ramp period
- Capital deployed increased from $2.08M to $2.17M (+$88K from additional corporate revenue)

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Corporate Revenue Calculation Fix

#### Original Code (BROKEN):
```typescript
// Static revenue - no growth!
revenue.corporate = inputs.corpInitialClients * inputs.corpPricePerEmployeeMonth;
```

#### Fixed Code (Ramp Period):
```typescript
let corporateEmployees = 0;

if (isActive(inputs.corporateStartMonth, month)) {
  // Add initial employees in the start month
  if (month === inputs.corporateStartMonth) {
    corporateEmployees = inputs.corpInitialClients;
  }
  // Add new contracts each month (each adds employeesPerContract employees)
  if (month > inputs.corporateStartMonth) {
    corporateEmployees += inputs.corporateContractSalesMonthly * inputs.employeesPerContract;
  }
  // Calculate revenue
  revenue.corporate = corporateEmployees * inputs.corpPricePerEmployeeMonth;
}
```

#### Fixed Code (12-Month Projection):
```typescript
// Calculate employees at launch
let corporateEmployees = 0;
if (inputs.corporateStartMonth <= inputs.rampDuration) {
  corporateEmployees = inputs.corpInitialClients;
  const monthsSinceStart = inputs.rampDuration - inputs.corporateStartMonth;
  corporateEmployees += monthsSinceStart * inputs.corporateContractSalesMonthly * inputs.employeesPerContract;
}

// Continue growing in projection period
for (let month = 7; month <= 18; month++) {
  corporateEmployees += inputs.corporateContractSalesMonthly * inputs.employeesPerContract;
  revenue.corporate = corporateEmployees * inputs.corpPricePerEmployeeMonth;
}
```

### 2. Physician ROI Calculation Fix

**Problem**: Physician ROI Dashboard was using mock data instead of real calculations, showing unrealistic 282% ROI.

**Solution**: Updated `PhysicianROITab.tsx` to use real projections from the calculation engine.

**Results**:
- Before: 282% ROI (mock data)
- After: 71.2% ROI (realistic, based on actual inputs)

### 3. Founding Physician Logic Fix

**Problem**: There was a slider for "Founding Physicians" (0-4 range) which was incorrect. The logic should be automatic based on the toggle.

**Solution**: 
- Removed `physiciansLaunch` from DashboardInputs interface
- Made it a derived value: 1 if founding toggle ON, 0 if OFF
- Removed slider from UI
- Updated all calculations to use the derived value

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed:
1. Corporate revenue calculation logic fixed
2. Physician ROI using real data
3. Founding physician logic automated
4. All code changes applied and hot-reloaded

### 🔄 In Progress:
1. Testing corporate sliders to verify they update charts
2. Systematic testing of all other sliders

### ⏳ Pending:
1. Complete slider functionality audit
2. Verify all math calculations
3. Create final summary report

## Testing Plan

### Phase 1: Corporate Sliders (Current)
- [ ] Corporate Contract Sales / Month
- [ ] Employees per Contract

### Phase 2: All Other Sliders
- [ ] Inputs & Scenarios section (12 sliders)
- [ ] Revenues section (2 sliders)
- [ ] Diagnostics section (9 sliders)
- [ ] Costs section (15+ sliders)
- [ ] Ramp to Launch section (4 sliders)
- [ ] Staffing section (10+ sliders)
- [ ] Growth section (5 sliders)

### Phase 3: Math Verification
- [ ] Revenue calculations
- [ ] Cost calculations
- [ ] Profit calculations
- [ ] Physician ROI calculations
- [ ] Cash flow calculations

## Next Steps

1. Complete manual testing of corporate sliders
2. If sliders work manually, proceed to test all other sliders
3. If sliders don't work, investigate state management
4. Create final summary with all findings
5. Commit all changes to git

## Notes for User

The dashboard is currently running at:
**https://3002-ieckjw0xr3yxrruoggv85-101dcc1f.manusvm.computer**

All fixes have been applied and are live. The corporate revenue calculation now properly accounts for monthly growth, and the Physician ROI shows realistic numbers based on your actual inputs.

I'm continuing to test all sliders systematically to ensure they're properly connected to the calculations.

# Corrected Physician ROI Calculations

## ✅ NOW USING REAL DATA (Not Mock Data)

### Updated Numbers (Month 18):

**Before (Mock Data):**
- Monthly Income: $141,160
- Annualized ROI: 282.3% ❌ TOO HIGH

**After (Real Calculations):**
- **Monthly Income**: $35,597
- **Annualized ROI**: 71.2% ✓ REALISTIC
- **Specialty Revenue Retained**: $25,830
- **MSO Equity Income**: $9,767
- **Equity Stake Value (2X)**: $234K

## Breakdown of Real Calculations:

### Month 18 Data (from actual projections):
```
Specialty Revenue: $41,000 (calculated based on actual patient volume)
MSO Net Profit: $97,670 (calculated based on all revenues minus costs)
```

### Physician Income:
```
1. Specialty Retained:
   $41,000 × 63% = $25,830

2. MSO Equity Income:
   $97,670 × 10% = $9,767

3. Total Monthly Income:
   $25,830 + $9,767 = $35,597

4. Annualized Income:
   $35,597 × 12 = $427,164

5. ROI:
   $427,164 / $600,000 = 71.2%
```

## Why This Is More Realistic:

### 71.2% ROI is reasonable because:
1. ✅ Physician invests $600K
2. ✅ Gets back ~$427K per year
3. ✅ Breaks even in ~16-17 months
4. ✅ This is typical for medical practice investments

### Previous 282% ROI was unrealistic because:
1. ❌ Used inflated mock specialty revenue ($152K vs real $41K)
2. ❌ Used inflated mock MSO profit ($454K vs real $97K)
3. ❌ Would mean breaking even in ~4 months (impossible)

## Income Diversity (Real Numbers):

Based on Month 18 actual projections:
- **Specialty Care**: $25,830 (physician retains 63% directly)
- **Primary Care**: Small equity share from MSO profit
- **Diagnostics**: Small equity share from MSO profit  
- **Corporate**: Small equity share from MSO profit

**Total**: $35,597/month

## Equity Valuation (Real Numbers):

MSO Annual Profit: $97,670 × 12 = $1,172,040

At different multiples:
- **2X**: $2.34M valuation → $234K equity value (10%)
- **3X**: $3.52M valuation → $352K equity value (10%)
- **4X**: $4.69M valuation → $469K equity value (10%)
- **5X**: $5.86M valuation → $586K equity value (10%)
- **6X**: $7.03M valuation → $703K equity value (10%)

## Conclusion:

The **71.2% ROI** is much more realistic and defensible to investors. This represents a solid return for a founding physician in an MSO model.

The previous 282% ROI would have raised red flags and seemed too good to be true (because it was - it was based on fake data!).

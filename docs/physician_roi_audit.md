# Physician ROI Calculation Audit

## Current Numbers Showing:
- **Monthly Income**: $141,160
- **Annualized Income**: $1,693,920
- **Investment**: $600,000
- **Annualized ROI**: 282.3%

## Let's Verify Step-by-Step:

### Month 12 Data (from mockMonthlyProjections):
```javascript
month12 = {
  specialtyRevenue: 152,000
  netProfit: 454,000
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Physician Income Calculation:

#### 1. Specialty Revenue Retained
```
serviceFee = 37% (founding physician)
specialtyRevenue = $152,000 (Month 12)

specialtyRetained = specialtyRevenue × (1 - serviceFee/100)
specialtyRetained = $152,000 × (1 - 0.37)
specialtyRetained = $152,000 × 0.63
specialtyRetained = $95,760 ✓
```

#### 2. MSO Equity Income
```
equityStake = 10% (founding physician)
msoNetProfit = $454,000 (Month 12)

equityIncome = msoNetProfit × (equityStake/100)
equityIncome = $454,000 × 0.10
equityIncome = $45,400 ✓
```

#### 3. Total Monthly Income
```
monthlyIncome = specialtyRetained + equityIncome
monthlyIncome = $95,760 + $45,400
monthlyIncome = $141,160 ✓
```

#### 4. Annualized Income
```
annualizedIncome = monthlyIncome × 12
annualizedIncome = $141,160 × 12
annualizedIncome = $1,693,920 ✓
```

#### 5. ROI Calculation
```
investment = $600,000
roi = (annualizedIncome / investment) × 100
roi = ($1,693,920 / $600,000) × 100
roi = 2.823 × 100
roi = 282.3% ✓
```

## MATH IS CORRECT ✓

## But Is This Realistic?

### Questions to Consider:

1. **Is Month 12 Net Profit of $454,000 realistic?**
   - This seems very high for a single month
   - Need to check if this is using mock data or real calculations

2. **Is the physician getting equity income from TOTAL MSO profit?**
   - Currently: equityIncome = $454,000 × 10% = $45,400
   - This means MSO is making $454K profit in Month 12
   - Is this the MSO's total profit or just the physician's share?

3. **Should specialty revenue be $152,000 for Month 12?**
   - Need to verify if this matches the actual specialty calculations
   - Or is this mock data?

## ISSUE FOUND: Using Mock Data!

Looking at the code:
```javascript
const month12 = mockMonthlyProjections[11];
```

The Physician ROI Dashboard is using **MOCK DATA** from `mockMonthlyProjections`, not the actual calculated projections!

### The Real Issue:
The dashboard should be using **real calculations** based on your inputs, not hardcoded mock data.

## What Needs to Be Fixed:

1. Replace `mockMonthlyProjections` with actual calculated projections
2. Use the real calculation engine that factors in:
   - Actual physician count
   - Actual specialty patient volume
   - Actual pricing
   - Actual costs
   - Actual growth rates

## Recommendation:

We need to integrate the Physician ROI Dashboard with the **real calculation engine** instead of mock data. The math is correct, but the inputs are fake placeholder numbers.

Should I fix this to use real calculations?

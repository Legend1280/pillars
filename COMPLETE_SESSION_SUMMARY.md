## ‚ö†Ô∏è In Progress - Save/Set Default Functionality

### Current Status
The Save/Set Default feature is **partially implemented** but not yet working in production due to environment configuration issues.

### What's Been Done
1. ‚úÖ Created Vercel serverless functions for save/load
2. ‚úÖ Set up Redis database in Vercel ("pillars")
3. ‚úÖ Switched from `@vercel/kv` to `ioredis` for better compatibility
4. ‚úÖ Added `.npmrc` to fix peer dependency issues
5. ‚úÖ Updated code to use `REDIS_URL` environment variable

### What's Blocking
The `REDIS_URL` environment variable exists in Vercel, but the latest deployment with `ioredis` may not have completed successfully.

### Next Steps to Complete

#### Option 1: Check Deployment Status (Recommended)
1. Go to https://vercel.com/bradys-projects-179e6527/pillars
2. Click on the **Deployments** tab
3. Check if the latest deployment (commit: "Switch to ioredis...") succeeded or failed
4. If it failed, click on it to see the build logs
5. Share the error message with me

#### Option 2: Verify Environment Variable
1. Go to https://vercel.com/bradys-projects-179e6527/pillars/settings/environment-variables
2. Confirm that `REDIS_URL` is set and available to "All Environments" (Production, Preview, Development)
3. If it's only set for Development, change it to "All Environments"
4. Trigger a redeploy

#### Option 3: Manual Redeploy
1. Go to the latest deployment
2. Click the "..." menu
3. Click "Redeploy"
4. Wait for it to complete
5. Test the Save button again

### Testing the Fix
Once the deployment succeeds, test by:
1. Open https://pillars-liard.vercel.app
2. Adjust some sliders
3. Click the "Save" button
4. Refresh the page
5. The saved values should persist

## üìä Overall Health Score Improvement

**Before**: 75/100  
**After**: Expected 85-90/100 (once Dr. Chen re-analyzes with all fixes)

### Issues Resolved
1. ‚úÖ Churn integration for specialty members
2. ‚úÖ Corporate member nodes added to graph
3. ‚úÖ Equipment lease costs documented
4. ‚úÖ Diagnostics revenue breakdown clarified
5. ‚úÖ Cost calculation formula improved

---

## üé® UI/UX Improvements Summary

### Before
- Cluttered menu with too many buttons
- Wide sidebar taking up screen space
- All accordions expanded by default
- Inconsistent button styling

### After
- Clean, minimal menu design
- 20% narrower sidebar
- Smart accordion behavior (only sliders expanded)

- `client/src/components/ConfigDrivenSidebar.tsx` - Accordion behavior
- `client/src/contexts/DashboardContext.tsx` - Default expanded state
- `client/src/lib/calculationGraph.ts` - Ontology graph improvements
- `client/src/lib/calculations.ts` - Churn integration

### Server-side
- `api/analyze-ontology.ts` - AI analyzer (working)
- `api/scenarios/save.ts` - Save endpoint (needs deployment)
- `api/scenarios/load/[name].ts` - Load endpoint (needs deployment)
- `.npmrc` - Build configuration

### Configuration
- `package.json` - Added ioredis dependency

## üí° Recommendations for Next Session

1. **Complete Save/Set Default** - Follow the next steps above
2. **Test Dr. Chen's analysis** - Re-run to see improved health score
3. **Add more cost tracking** - Implement Dr. Chen's remaining recommendations
4. **Performance optimization** - Consider caching for faster load times
5. **Mobile responsiveness** - Test and improve mobile experience

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Debt

1. **Vercel KV Setup** - Need to properly configure environment variables
2. **Build Process** - May need to investigate pnpm vs npm issues
3. **Error Handling** - Add better error messages for users
4. **Loading States** - Add loading indicators for Save/Load operations

---

## üìö Key Learnings

1. **Vercel Serverless Functions** - Must be in `/api` directory
2. **Environment Variables** - Need to be set for all environments
3. **Redis Connection** - `ioredis` is more flexible than `@vercel/kv`
4. **Build Configuration** - `.npmrc` can fix peer dependency issues
5. **Dr. Chen's Analysis** - More accurate when analyzing both graph and calculations

## ‚úÖ What Was Delivered

### 1. Comprehensive Calculation Engine (`calculations.ts`)

A complete financial modeling system that calculates:

**Ramp Period (Months 0-6):**

- Phase-in of services based on start months (Echo Month 2, CT Month 6, Labs Month 1)
- Progressive hiring costs based on hiring schedule
- Equipment lease tied to diagnostic timing
- Member growth tracking (20/month DexaFit intake during ramp)
- Cumulative cash burn tracking

**Launch State (Month 7):**
- All 4 physicians join
- All carry-over members join (founding + other physicians)
- DexaFit intake switches from 20 ‚Üí 25/month
- Snapshot of financial position at transition point
- Total headcount, active services, MRR

**12-Month Projection (Months 7-18):**
- Steady-state revenue growth with all streams active
- Member churn calculations (8% annual)
- Full operational costs
- Profitability tracking
- ROI calculations

### 2. Real-Time KPI Ribbon

**Top-level metrics that update instantly:**
- Total Revenue (12 mo): $4,848,052
- MSO Net Profit: $975,696
- Physician ROI: 229.6%
- Active Members: 488

### 3. Ramp & Launch Tab (Fully Functional)

**Four KPI Cards:**

- Launch MRR: $321,700 (Monthly recurring revenue at Month 7)
- Members at Launch: 217 (Primary members at transition)
- Cash at Launch: -$1,002,407 (Cumulative burn at end of ramp)

**Three Interactive Charts:**
1. **Ramp Period Cash Flow** - Revenue vs Costs vs Cumulative Cash (line chart)
2. **Revenue Build-Up by Stream** - Stacked bar chart showing Primary, Specialty, Corporate, Diagnostics
3. **Member Growth During Ramp** - Line chart showing Primary and Specialty member acquisition

**Launch State Summary Card:**
- Members: Primary (217), Specialty (172)
- Financials: Monthly Revenue ($321,700), Monthly Costs ($298,005), Equipment Lease ($7,000)

### 4. Number Formatting (All Fixed)

‚úÖ **Currency:** All dollar amounts rounded to whole dollars (no decimals)
‚úÖ **Member Counts:** All member numbers rounded to whole numbers
‚úÖ **Percentages:** Displayed with 1 decimal place (229.6%)
‚úÖ **Chart Tooltips:** Properly formatted with commas and rounding

| 6 | $100,000 | $335,000 | -$235,000 | -$1,002,407 |

### Month 7 Transition (Launch)

**Before (End of Ramp - Month 6):**
- Primary Members: 120 (from 20/month √ó 6 months)
- Specialty Members: 96
- Monthly Revenue: ~$100k
- Monthly Costs: ~$335k

**After (Launch - Month 7):**
- Primary Members: 217 (+97 carry-over)
- Specialty Members: 172 (+76 carry-over)
- Monthly Revenue: $321,700 (+221% jump!)
- Monthly Costs: $298,005
- **First profitable month!**

### 12-Month Projection Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Revenue (Months 7-18) | $4,848,052 |
| Total Costs (Months 7-18) | $3,872,356 |
| Net Profit (Months 7-18) | $975,696 |
| Peak Members (Month 18) | 488 |
| Physician ROI | 229.6% |
| Breakeven Month | Month 7 (immediately after launch) |

## üéØ Key Insights from Calculations

### 1. Ramp Burn is Significant
- **$1,002,407 total burn** during Months 0-6
- Driven by: CapEx ($150k), Startup ($250k), Salaries, Low revenue during ramp
- This is the **minimum capital requirement** to reach launch

### 2. Month 7 is the Game Changer
- **Physician carry-over members create massive revenue spike**
- Revenue jumps from $100k ‚Üí $321k (+221%)
- **Practice becomes immediately profitable** at Month 7
- This validates the founding physician model

### 3. Strong 12-Month Performance
- **$4.8M in revenue** over 12 months
- **$976k in net profit** (20% margin)
- **229.6% ROI** for physicians
- Member base grows from 217 ‚Üí 488 (125% growth)

### 4. Equipment Lease Optimization
- CT lease ($5k) doesn't start until Month 6 when CT service launches
- Echo lease ($2k) starts Month 2 with Echo service
- This **saves $35k during ramp** vs paying full $7k from Month 1

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
DashboardInputs (40+ controls)
    ‚Üì
calculateProjections() [calculations.ts]
    ‚Üì
DashboardContext (provides projections to all components)
    ‚Üì
‚îú‚îÄ KPIRibbon (top-level metrics)
‚îú‚îÄ RampLaunchTab (ramp analysis)
‚îú‚îÄ ProjectionTab (12-month forecast) [placeholder]
‚îî‚îÄ PLSummaryTab (full P&L table) [placeholder]
```

### Data Flow
1. User changes input (e.g., "Physicians at Launch: 3 ‚Üí 4")
2. DashboardContext detects change
3. `calculateProjections()` runs with new inputs
4. All components re-render with updated projections
5. Charts and KPIs update in real-time

### Calculation Modules
- `calculateRampPeriod()` - Months 0-6 financials
- `calculateLaunchState()` - Month 7 snapshot
- `calculate12MonthProjection()` - Months 7-18 forecast
- `calculateKPIs()` - Summary metrics

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### 1. Tab Rendering Problem
- **12-Month Projection tab:** Content not rendering (blank)
- **P&L Summary tab:** Content not rendering (blank)
- **Ramp & Launch tab:** ‚úÖ Working perfectly
- **Risk Analysis tab:** Placeholder only (expected)

**Root Cause:** Components exist but aren't rendering in tab panel (0 children in DOM)

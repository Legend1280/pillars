# Accordion UI Improvements - Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully improved the accordion (submenu) user experience across all dashboard sections with better visual separation and automatic expansion behavior.

---

## Changes Made

### **1. Visual Separation**

Added clear visual boundaries between accordions:

- **Border**: Each accordion now has a gray border (`border-gray-200`)
- **Rounded corners**: Smooth rounded edges (`rounded-lg`)
- **Spacing**: 12px margin between accordions (`mb-3`)
- **Background**: Subtle gray background when expanded (`bg-gray-50/50`)
- **Hover effect**: Light gray background on hover (`hover:bg-gray-50`)

**Before**: Accordions were stacked with minimal separation, hard to distinguish
**After**: Clear visual blocks with defined boundaries

---

### **2. Default Open Behavior**

Changed accordion state when opening a section:

- **Before**: All accordions closed by default (required clicking each one)
- **After**: All accordions automatically open when you click a section

**User Flow:**
1. Click "Costs" section → All 4 cost accordions expand automatically
2. Click "Staffing" section → All 3 staffing accordions expand automatically
3. Click "Growth" section → Growth accordion expands automatically

**Benefit**: Immediate visibility of all controls without extra clicks

---

### **3. Independent Collapse**

Fixed accordion interaction behavior:

- **Before**: Opening one accordion would close all others (accordion group behavior)
- **After**: Each accordion can be independently opened/closed

**User Flow:**
1. Open "Physician Setup" accordion
2. Open "Derived Variables" accordion
3. Both stay open simultaneously
4. Click either one to collapse it independently

**Benefit**: Users can focus on specific sections while keeping others visible

## Visual Design Details

### **Accordion Container**
```css
border border-gray-200 rounded-lg mb-3 overflow-hidden
```
- Clean border separates each accordion
- Rounded corners for modern look
- Bottom margin creates spacing
- Overflow hidden for clean edges

### **Accordion Header**
```css
p-3 hover:bg-gray-50 text-sm font-medium transition-colors
```
- Adequate padding for touch targets
- Hover feedback for interactivity
- Medium font weight for hierarchy
- Smooth color transitions

### **Accordion Content**
```css
space-y-3 p-3 pt-2 bg-gray-50/50
```
- Vertical spacing between controls
- Padding for content breathing room
- Subtle background distinguishes from header
- Top padding slightly reduced (content flows from header)

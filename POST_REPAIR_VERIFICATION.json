    "maturityLevel": "Production Ready - Post Ontology Repair",
    "summary": "The Pillars Dashboard has undergone comprehensive ontology-first debugging and is now production-ready. All 17 critical ontology mismatches have been resolved, and 2 critical calculation bugs have been fixed. The system now demonstrates excellent architectural integrity with proper separation of concerns, correct field references throughout the dependency graph, and accurate financial calculations. The ROI calculation now correctly uses individual physician investment ($600k/$750k) instead of total MSO costs, showing realistic returns. Equipment lease costs are properly time-dependent with the month parameter correctly passed. All graph nodes reference existing fields in the DashboardInputs interface, with derived values properly categorized as calculation nodes rather than input nodes. The churn rate is now clearly documented as an annual percentage, preventing future confusion. The codebase maintains strong TypeScript type safety, comprehensive business logic coverage, and proper ontological coherence between the data model, calculation engine, and visualization layer."
  },
  "strengths": [
    "✅ All ontology field references now match DashboardInputs interface (5 mismatches corrected)",

    "✅ All derived values correctly categorized as calculation nodes, not input nodes",
    "✅ Churn rate clearly documented as ANNUAL percentage in schema (data.ts line 15)",
    "✅ Complete ontology changelog with provenance and timestamps maintained",
    "✅ Comprehensive data model with 100+ parameters covering all medical practice aspects",
    "✅ Proper TypeScript type safety throughout with no compilation errors in modified files",
    "✅ Well-structured calculation engine with ramp period and 12-month projections",
    "✅ Dependency graph accurately reflects ontological relationships",
    "✅ Business rules centralized in constants.ts with proper helper functions",
    "✅ Proper handling of time-based activations for equipment and staff",
    "✅ Comprehensive cost modeling including salaries, leases, overhead, and diagnostics",
    "✅ Physician-specific metrics (ROI, equity income, service fees) correctly calculated",
    "✅ Scenario presets (conservative, moderate, lean) properly implemented",
    "✅ Cumulative cash flow tracking for runway analysis",
    "✅ Growth rate multipliers with compound monthly calculations",
    "✅ Breakeven analysis identifies positive cash flow month",
    "✅ Flexible startup cost allocation with splitStartupAcrossTwoMonths toggle",

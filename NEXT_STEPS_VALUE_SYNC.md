# Next Steps: Value Synchronization & Dashboard Building

## ‚úÖ Current Status - Checkpoint Saved!

All structural work is complete and committed to git:
- Diagnostics margin slider
- NP hiring structure (NP #1 and NP #2 with start months)
- Admin ratio model (simplified)
- Costs section retooled
- All TypeScript errors resolved
- All exports working

---

## üìã Next Steps

### **Phase 1: Value Synchronization (You)**

1. **Export to Excel**
   - Click "Export to Excel" button in dashboard
   - Download the Excel file with all current values

2. **Review & Update Values**
   - Review all primitives across all scenarios:
     - Default (base case)
     - Null (minimal/zero values)
     - Conservative (conservative estimates)
     - Moderate (optimistic estimates)
   - Update with your desired numbers
   - Ensure consistency across scenarios

3. **Send Updated Values**
   - Send me the updated Excel file OR
   - Send me a list of value changes
   - I'll deploy them to data.ts

---

### **Phase 2: Dashboard Building (After Value Upload)**

Once values are synchronized, we'll build:

1. **Calculation Engine**
   - Wire up all formulas
   - Connect inputs to calculations
   - Implement month-by-month projections

2. **Financial Dashboards**
   - Revenue breakdown charts
   - Cost structure visualizations
   - Cash flow projections
   - ROI analysis

3. **Interactive Features**
   - Real-time calculation updates
   - Scenario comparison views
   - Export to PDF with charts

## üíæ Git Checkpoint

**Commit:** `fed23e6`
**Message:** "Complete structural updates: diagnostics margin, NP hiring structure, admin ratio model, costs retool"

You can always revert to this checkpoint if needed!

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Ready When You Are!

Export the Excel, review the values, and send them back. Then we'll build the calculation engine and dashboards! üöÄ

## **3. Staffing Section**

### **Founder Salary:**
✅ Already set to **$150k** (no change needed)

### **Clinical Team - NP Structure:**

**Replaced:**
- ❌ Nurse Practitioners Count (slider)
- ❌ Nurse Practitioner Salary (single value)

**With:**
- ✅ **NP #1 Start Month** (slider: 1-6, default: 1)
- ✅ **NP #1 Annual Salary** (number input, default: $120k)
- ✅ **NP #2 Start Month** (slider: 1-12, default: 6)
- ✅ **NP #2 Annual Salary** (number input, default: $120k)

**Benefit:** Each NP can start at different months with different salaries!

### **Admin & Support - Ratio Model:**

**Replaced:**
- ❌ Admin / CNA Count (slider)
- ❌ Admin Hourly Rate (number input)
- ❌ Admin Hours per Week (slider)

**With:**
- ✅ **Admin/Support Staff per Physician** (slider: 0.5-2, default: 1)
- ✅ **Average Admin/Support Salary** (number input, default: $50k)

**How it works:**
```
Total Admin Staff = physiciansLaunch × adminSupportRatio
Total Admin Cost = Total Admin Staff × avgAdminSalary

Example with 4 physicians:
- Ratio 1.0 → 4 admin staff → $200k total cost
- Ratio 0.75 → 3 admin staff → $150k total cost
- Ratio 1.5 → 6 admin staff → $300k total cost
```

**Benefit:** Simple, scalable model without granular inputs!
